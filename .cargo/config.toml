# Targeting x86-64-v2 gives a ~2% performance boost while only
# disallowing Intel CPUs older than 2008 and AMD CPUs older than 2011.
# None of those very old CPUs are used in GCP
# (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms). Unfortunately,
# AWS does not seem to disclose the exact CPUs they use.
